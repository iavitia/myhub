# My Learning Hub

> I designed this "hub" to be a central repository of things that I have been working on that are career related. I did this so that I can document projects that I've worked on, show that I know the material, and show my process behind it. There is also a "notes" section that acts as a wiki of notes, references, and documentation that I've found useful while studying. The last section, "extra courses," is an overview of courses I've taken, and there project files, that have helped me gain additional knowledge.
