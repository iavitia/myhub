# Exam Ref 70-761 Querying Data with Transact-SQL

Transact-SQL is the main language used to manage and manipulate data in Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL Database.

## Managing data with T-SQL

### Logical query processing
T-SQL has both logical and physical sides to it. The logical side is the conceptual interpretation of the query that explains what the correct result of the query is. The physical side is the processing of the query by the database engine. Physical processing must produce the result defined by logical query processing. The database engine can optimize the query by rearranging steps from logical query processing or remove steps altogether, but only as long as the result remains the one defined by logical query processing. Because of this, it's important not to draw any performance-related conclusions from what you are reviewing about logical query processing. since it only defines the correctness of the query. 

Syntax for writing SELECT statements are ordered as such:
```sql
SELECT  
FROM
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
ORDER BY
```
Logical query processing orders the clauses as such:
```sql
FROM  
WHERE
GROUP BY
HAVING
SELECT
ORDER BY
```
Each phase operates on one or more tables as inputs and returns a virtual table as output. The output table of one phase is considered the input to the next phase. This is in accord with operations on relations that yield a relation. If an ORDER BY is specified, the result isn’t relational. This means that you can’t operate on such result with an outer query because an outer query expects a relation as input. The output of the ORDER BY phase isn’t relational because it has a guaranteed order. The result of this phase is what standard SQL calls a cursor.

Since the WHERE clause comes before the SELECT clause in logical query processing, it can not refer to an alias defined in the SELECT clause. However, the ORDER BY clause is the first and only clause that is allowed to refer to column aliases defined in the SELECT clause. In addition, alias's created during the SELECT phase are not visible to other expressions that appear in the same SELECT list. This is because expressions that appear in the same logical query-processing step are treated as a set, and a set has no order. T-SQL evaluates all expressions that appear in the same phase in an all-at-once manner. For example, this code will not work:
```sql
SELECT YEAR(hiredate) AS yearhired, yearhired - 1 AS prevyear
FROM HR.Employees;
```
It’s important to understand the difference between WHERE and HAVING. The WHERE clause is evaluated before rows are grouped, and therefore is evaluated per row. The HAVING clause is evaluated after rows are grouped, and therefore is evaluated per group.

### SELECT
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
FROM table_name;
```
The SQL SELECT statement is used to fetch the data from a database table which returns this data in the form of a result table. These result tables are called result-sets. The SELECT clause of a query has two main roles: 
* It evaluates expressions that define the attributes in the query’s result, assigning them with aliases if needed. 
* Using a DISTINCT clause, you can eliminate duplicate rows in the result if needed.

#### FROM
The FROM clause is the first clause to be evaluated logically in a SELECT query. The FROM clause has two main roles:
* It’s the clause where you indicate the tables that you want to query.
* It’s the clause where you can apply table operators like joins to input tables.

Using AS is recommended for defining aliases because it's both standard and is the most readable. There are two main uses for intentional attribute aliasing. One is renaming when you need the result attribute to be named differently than the source attribute. Another use is to assign a name to an attribute that results from an expression that would otherwise be unnamed. In this example, employeeid is intentional for readability and the full name concatenation will return with no attribute name:

```sql
SELECT empid AS EmployeeID, firstname + N' ' + lastname 
FROM HR.Employees;
```
#### WHERE
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition]
```
The WHERE clause is used to filter records. All rows for which the predicate in the WHERE clause is True are affected (or returned) by the SQL DML statement or query. Rows for which the predicate evaluates to False or Unknown (NULL) are unaffected by the DML statement or query. Simple predicates use one of the operators =, <>, >, >=, <, <=, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, IS NULL or IS NOT NULL. A couple examples can include:

| Operator | Description                                   | Example                                  |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| IN       | Find all people in multiple locations         | WHERE person IN ('Montreal', 'Quebec')   |
| BETWEEN  | find date within a range                      | WHERE bday BETWEEN 'value1' AND 'value2' |
| LIKE     | Find any name that begins with the letter 'S' | WHERE name LIKE 'S%';                    |

##### LIKE

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE columnN [NOT] LIKE pattern;
```

The LIKE condition is used to filter character string data (regular or unicode) based on pattern matching. It also supports wildcards that you can use in your patterns. Wildcards that you can ise in your LIKE pattern include:

| Wildcard           | Meaning                           | Example                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| % (percent sign)   | Any string including an empty one | ‘D%’: string starting with D                    |
| _ (underscore)     | A single character                | ‘_D%’: string where second character is D       |
| [<character list>] | A single character from a list    | ‘[AC]%’: string where first character is A or C |
| [<character range>] | A single character from a range    | ‘[0-9]%’: string where first character is a digit|
| [^<character list or range>] | A single character that is not in the list or range    | ‘[^0-9]%’: string where first character is not a digit|

#### ORDER BY
```sql 
SELECT column_ist
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column1, column2, columnN [ ASC  | DESC ];
```
A query that doesn’t have an explicit instruction to return the rows in a particular order doesn’t guarantee the order of rows in the result. When you do need such a guarantee, the only way to provide it is by adding an ORDER BY clause to the query. You can indicate the ordering direction on an expression-by-expression basis, as in ORDER BY col1 DESC, col2, col3 DESC (col1 descending, then col2 ascending, then col3 descending).

#### TOP
```sql 
SELECT TOP (top_value) [ PERCENT ] column_list
FROM table_name
WHERE [conditions]
ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ];
```
The SQL SELECT TOP statement is used to retrieve records from one or more tables in a database and limit the number of records returned based on a fixed value or percentage.

TOP will return the top number of rows in the result set based on top_value. In this example, TOP(10) will return the top 10 sales records from the full result set. Although the ORDER BY clause isn't mandatory, there is no guarantee which 10 rows will be returned so it is important to specify an ORDER BY direction if needed. 
```sql
SELECT TOP (10) sales
FROM sales
ORDER BY sales DESC;
```
If you really want three random rows, it might be a good idea to add an ORDER BY clause with the expression (SELECT NULL) to let people know that your choice is intentional and not an oversight.
```sql
SELECT TOP (10) sales
FROM sales
ORDER BY (SELECT NULL);
```
If PERCENT is specified, then the top rows are based on a percentage of the total result set (as specified by the top_value). For example, TOP(10) PERCENT would return the top 10% of the full result set.
```sql
SELECT TOP (10) PERCENT firstName
FROM people
ORDER BY firstName ASC;
```
WITH TIES is used when you want to return two or more rows that tie for last place in the limited results set. Must be used with the ORDER BY clause. WITH TIES may cause more rows to be returned than the value specified in expression. For example, if expression is set to 3 but 2 additional rows match the values of the ORDER BY columns in row 3, the result set will contain 5 rows. 
```sql
SELECT TOP (3) WITH TIES orderid, orderdate, custid, empid 
FROM Sales.Orders 
ORDER BY orderdate DESC;
```

#### OFFSET-FETCH
```sql
SELECT column_names
FROM table_name
ORDER BY column_names [ ASC | DESC ]
OFFSET n ROWS
FETCH NEXT m ROWS ONLY
 ```
The OFFSET-FETCH option is a filtering option that, like TOP, you can use to filter data based on a specified number of rows and ordering. But unlike TOP, it is standard, and also has a skipping capability, making it useful for ad-hoc paging purposes.In T-SQL, they require an ORDER BY clause to be present. Also, in T-SQL, a FETCH clause requires an OFFSET clause to be present. You first specify the OFFSET clause indicating how many rows you want to skip (0 if you don’t want to skip any); you then optionally specify the FETCH clause indicating how many rows you want to filter.

If you want to return the rows without a specified order, you can specify the expression (SELECT NULL) in the ORDER BY clause, as follows:
```sql
SELECT orderid, orderdate, custid, empid 
FROM Sales.Orders 
ORDER BY (SELECT NULL) 
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH FIRST 3 ROWS ONLY;
```
With both the OFFSET and the FETCH clauses, you can use expressions as inputs. For example:
```sql
DECLARE @pagesize AS BIGINT = 25, @pagenum AS BIGINT = 3; 
 
SELECT orderid, orderdate, custid, empid 
FROM Sales.Orders 
ORDER BY orderdate DESC, orderid DESC 
OFFSET (@pagenum - 1) * @pagesize ROWS FETCH NEXT @pagesize ROWS ONLY;
```

#### SELECT Best practices
* It is considered a best practice to always explicitly indicate the schema name in the FROM clause. This practice can prevent you from ending up with a schema name that you did not intend to use, and can also remove the cost involved in the implicit resolution process, although this cost is minor.
* T-SQL supports using an asterisk(*) to list all attributes from the input table; however, it is considered a bad practice and you should always explicitly list the attributes that you need.
* In a SELECT statement, always use an ORDER BY clause with the TOP clause. This is the only way to predictably indicate which rows are affected by TOP.
* Because the OFFSET-FETCH option is standard and TOP isn’t, in cases where they are logically equivalent, it’s recommended to stick to the former.

### Union
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1

UNION

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
ORDER BY column_names
```
UNION is used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements. It also has an implied DISTINCT property, meaning that it does not return duplicate rows. The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries. Data types must also be compatible with one another.
#### Union all
```sql
SELECT column_name(s) FROM table1

UNION ALL

SELECT column_name(s) FROM table2;
ORDER BY column_names
```
Union All incorporates all rows into the results. This includes duplicates. If not specified, duplicate rows are removed. There is a performance hit when using UNION instead of UNION ALL, since the database server must do additional work to remove the duplicate rows so you should understand if your query contains duplicates before using one or the other.


### INTERSECT
```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table_list_
WHERE [condition]

INTERSECT

SELECT column_list
FROM table_list_
WHERE [condition]
```
The INTERSECT operator returns only distinct rows that are common to both sets. If a row appears at least once in the first set and at least once in the second set, it appears once in the result of the INTERSECT operator. If a record exists in one query and not in the other, it will be omitted from the INTERSECT results.

### EXCEPT
```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM table_list_
WHERE [condition]

EXCEPT

SELECT column_list
FROM table_list_
WHERE [condition]
```
The EXCEPT operator returns distinct rows that appear in the result of the first query but not the second. In other words, if a row appears at least once in the first query result and zero times in the second, it’s returned once in the output. The order of the queries matter with EXCEPT because it is returning the results from the first query.

### Joins
Often, data that you need to query is spread across multiple tables. The tables are usually related through keys, such as a foreign key in one side and a primary key in the other. Then you can use joins to query the data from the different tables and match the rows that need to be related. The different types of joins that T-SQL supports includes: cross, inner, and outer. The illustrations used in this section come from [The Data School.](https://dataschool.com)
#### Cross
```sql
SELECT column_list
FROM   First_tale
CROSS JOIN second_table
```
A cross join is the simplest type of join, though not the most commonly used one. This join performs what’s known as a Cartesian product of the two input tables. In other words, it performs a multiplication between the tables, yielding a row for each combination of rows from both sides. If you have m rows in table T1 and n rows in table T2, the result of a cross join between T1 and T2 is a virtual table with m × n rows.

![Cross Joins](https://1k2osthya1iaqacw1f9dgs95-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Inner-Join-1.gif)

 SQL Server knows that with a cross join followed by a filter it can evaluate the filters first (which is especially efficient when there are indexes to support the filters), and then match the remaining rows. This optimization technique is called predicate pushdown.
#### Inner
```sql
SELECT table1.column1, table2.column2...
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_field = table2.common_field;
```
![Inner Join](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/img_innerjoin.gif)

With an inner join, you can match rows from two tables based on a predicate—usually one that compares a primary key value in one side to a foreign key value in another side. The join's predicate is specified in the ON clause. 

The INNER JOIN creates a new result table by combining column values of two tables (table1 and table2) based upon the join-predicate. The query compares each row of table1 with each row of table2 to find all pairs of rows which satisfy the join-predicate. When the join-predicate is satisfied, column values for each matched pair of rows of A and B are combined into a result row.
